Working in Cards team, I am part of a team using Java and AWS Platform to develop an integration between Mambu and its partners. I was part in the development life-cycle by contributing to design along with an older and more experienced team and took part to implementation and testing phases. I implemented different card transaction types and took part of the architecture design and redesign
for the code optimization.</p>

<ul>
<li>I also have experience in integrating third parties to the Mambu platform
using low-code alongside JavaScript code with Multi Party Orchestration software (MPO) and Java/Javascript with MIB integration tool.</li>

<li> I have taken accountability for all my actions, being responsible for each one of
my task's life-cycle, from development to writing documentation and handling
the demo and handover to the client.</li>

<li> Another important part of my job was mitigating production incidents by
directly communicating with the client and finding long-term solutions in a
time constraint.</li>

<li> Besides these initiatives where I was mainly responsible I have also been
working on 3 different products, constantly changing context in a fast-paced
environment by switching technologies from MPO to MIB ending with plain Java.</li>

<li> I work in an international team using the Agile methodology and English as
the main language.</li>

<li> I was fully responsible for Java project where I've tested 6 different Java JSON manilulation libraries in order to choose the best one for our current project</li>

<li> I used platforms such as Gitlab, Confluence and Jira in order to effectively
communicate and work with several teams.</li>
